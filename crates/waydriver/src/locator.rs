//! XPath-based lazy locators for AT-SPI elements.
//!
//! A [`Locator`] bundles an [`Arc<Session>`] with an XPath expression. It
//! does **not** resolve until an async method is called on it — every
//! resolution takes a fresh AT-SPI snapshot, so locators survive widget
//! reparenting and destruction+recreation (dialog close/reopen, virtualized
//! list scroll, etc.) without manual retries.
//!
//! **Auto-wait.** Action methods (`click`, `set_text`) and metadata reads
//! (`name`, `role`, `text`, …) automatically poll with exponential backoff
//! until the element is resolvable — and, for actions, actionable (showing
//! and enabled) — within the session's default timeout. Override per-locator
//! with [`Locator::with_timeout`].
//!
//! **Explicit waits** come in three layered shapes. Pick the tightest one
//! your case fits:
//!
//! - [`Locator::wait_until`] — sync `Fn(&[ElementInfo]) -> bool` predicate.
//!   The common case: classify the current snapshot with no I/O in the
//!   predicate. Plus the family of shortcut methods built on it:
//!   [`wait_for_visible`](Locator::wait_for_visible),
//!   [`wait_for_hidden`](Locator::wait_for_hidden),
//!   [`wait_for_enabled`](Locator::wait_for_enabled),
//!   [`wait_for_count`](Locator::wait_for_count),
//!   [`wait_for_checked`](Locator::wait_for_checked), and siblings.
//! - [`Locator::wait_until_async`] — async `Fn(Vec<ElementInfo>) -> Fut<bool>`.
//!   Use when the predicate itself needs I/O (reading another locator, a
//!   live text or bounds call, the filesystem, …).
//! - [`Locator::wait_for`] — async, with `Result<Option<T>>` return. The
//!   general primitive: predicate can map to any output type and surface
//!   retriable errors. Use when the other two don't fit
//!   ([`wait_for_text`](Locator::wait_for_text) is a good worked example).
//!
//! Single-target methods (`click`, `name`, `text`, …) expect the selector to
//! match exactly one element and return [`Error::AmbiguousSelector`]
//! immediately — ambiguity is treated as a selector bug, not a retriable
//! condition. Disambiguate with [`Locator::nth`] / [`Locator::first`] /
//! [`Locator::last`] or refine the XPath.
